# linear-regression-from-scratch

This project demonstrates how to implement linear regression using the gradient descent algorithm from scratch. It predicts student scores based on the number of hours studied.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict student scores based on the number of hours studied. The linear regression model is trained using the gradient descent optimization algorithm. This project does not rely on any machine learning libraries like `sklearn`, but instead focuses on implementing the algorithm manually.

## Files

- `student_scores.csv`: The dataset containing the `Hours` and `Scores` of students.
- `linear_regression_from_scratch.py`: Python script that implements linear regression using gradient descent.

## Dataset

The `student_scores.csv` file consists of two columns:
- `Hours`: The number of hours a student has studied.
- `Scores`: The score the student obtained.
